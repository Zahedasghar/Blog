    "text": "World has been changing very fast due to the digital revolution and other technological changes. Covid-19 disruption has accelerated the pace of penetration of digital technologies, artificial intelligence and machine learning even in the lives of common people. After Covid-19 pandemic many jobs have either become obsolete or at least require a new/updated set of skills to continue one's job. Many workers will never regain their pre-covid jobs as those jobs will never be back in the market and many new post-covid jobs skills may be more challenging and or different in nature. Fast technological changes have made so many new jobs available. What are skills required for future jobs is a question whose answer is not known to anyone because there are a large number of future jobs which don't exist yet. What is a way forward in such a situation? This requires deep introspection and integrated thinking about the learning model to be adopted. \nMoreover, life expectancy has been increasing by two to three years with each decade in the past two centuries. It is expected that life expectancy of people born in the next 30 years may reach 150 years. With increased life expectancy and work life spanning over 50 to 80 years , there will be a remote possibility that one enters a job and retires from there. One has to switch more than a dozen jobs in one's life span. Each job will have a somewhat different nature of skills, so one can be in the job market only if one is continuously updating one's skills.\nDue to increased life expectancy, one has to re-imagine LEARN, EARN AND REST to LEARN and EARN, LEARN and EARN, and LEARN and EARN… This continuously changing nature of job skills demands that one has to adapt oneself in a continuous learning mode to meet future challenges. \n According to Sohail Inayatullah (futurist), often organizations think when some disruption happens or they miss something. Futuristic thinking means that working on problems before some structural change makes one redundant. According to him, often people think about the future, it is out there- Robotic, Space travel, etc. Future is not like an empty space, it is like the past. It is an active aspect of the present and thinking about the future is to change as today.\nNow the question is: are there such opportunities of continuously improving one's skills or learning new skills? Many jobs still prefer a degree and ask what one knows rather than what one can do. To resolve the issue of having a degree for those who have skills, are we ready for part time learning opportunities in our universities and colleges? This will help millions who have the skills but are unable to get decent jobs because the degree signaling effect is very strong. Are there programs available where one can learn new skills while staying on job? Will our universities serve those who are unserved?\nEven if our graduates are well trained and have requisite skills for the job market, there is a skill gap emerging overtime due to technological advances. As a result either they will become less productive or unemployed altogether. Currently, there are very limited opportunities available for upskilling.\nMoreover, who will cater the needs of burgeoning youth who didn’t get opportunities for higher education either due to high cost of education or due to somehow getting lower scores in some class(es) and did not secure a seat. These fundamental questions need to be addressed at national, provincial, regional and university level.\nHow is our education system taking up this pace of technology change? Are we preparing children for jobs of the future and kinds of industry and economy within that when they leave college/university? Jeremy Howard (data scientist and AI) says not at all. He says its sad that basic computer skills and basic data analysis tools are not taught the way it should be even in the US.In her book Long Life Learning: Preparing for Jobs that Don't Even Exist Yet ,Michelle R. Weise asks for developing a comprehensive Learning Ecosystem and to shift goal posts from TIME as fixed and LEARNING as variable to keep LEARNING fixed and TIME as variable. When LEARNING will be fixed then it will not matter whether its online platform or Physical (full time/part time) as one can’t go to the next step unless one has those pre-requisite skills. She also emphasizes that the university learning ecosystem should enable graduates to start moving on a continuous learning path rather than simply focusing on imparting certain skills. It’s a very timely book providing enough food for thought for all of us to rethink our higher education system to meet the challenges of new technologies\nPakistan has a youth bulge and economic growth is not sufficient to absorb it in the labor force market. On the positive aspect, due to digital technologies many jobs have become global in nature. How can one compete in a fast changing domestic and global market in the Silicon Valley era? Traditional university education system is misaligned with the current job market and simply adding a technological learning management system to it will not resolve the issue. The future of both higher education and jobs is uncertain, and many potential futures exist. In order to move from a future we don’t want to move to a future we want, we have to think and practice boldly.\nIn her book Long Life Learning: Preparing for Jobs that Don't Even Exist Yet ,Michelle R. Weise highlights that due to the fast changing world and due to rapid emergence and penetration of digital technologies, artificial intelligence, Machine Learning among many others, there is a need to develop a new learning ecosystem. This book is written mainly for a country like the United States but these points are equally important for low income countries like Pakistan."

    "text": "Importance of Extracting Data from PDFs\nExtracting tables from PDF files is crucial for several reasons:\n\nData Accessibility: Many important documents and reports are shared in PDF format. Extracting data from these documents makes it accessible for analysis and further use.\nAutomated Data Processing: Manual data entry from PDFs is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated extraction ensures accuracy and efficiency.\nData Integration: Extracting data from PDFs allows for the integration of information from various sources, enhancing the comprehensiveness of data analysis.\nHistorical Data Analysis: Many historical documents are available only in PDF format. Extracting data from these PDFs allows for the analysis of trends over time.\nEnhanced Decision Making: Having access to data in an analyzable format helps in making informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.\n\nSo extracting tables from PDFs is a critical skill that enables access to important data, ensures accuracy, and saves time in data processing.We can automate the process and make the data extraction workflow more efficient. This not only improves productivity but also ensures that the data extracted is accurate and reliable, providing a solid foundation for any subsequent analysis or decision-making processes.\nGiven these reasons, it’s evident why efficient tools for extracting data from PDFs are invaluable. So lets learn how to extract data from PDFs using the tabulapdf package in R."

The book is both a thrilling and alarming dive into AI’s potential, showcasing its remarkable breakthroughs and the significant concerns it raises.\nHerding begins by highlighting the unprecedented speed at which AI researchers, armed with vast data and computational power, are achieving breakthroughs. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize various fields, from accurately diagnosing diseases to analyzing vast amounts of text data for profound insights. However, this great promise is tempered by the potential for unethical, disturbing, and dangerous uses of AI technology.\nA critical section of the book addresses the ethical dilemmas posed by AI. Herding points out the troubling frequency of mistakes in facial recognition technology, which disproportionately affect black and brown races, leading to serious consequences such as the wrongful victimization of innocent people. She also critiques Amazon for treating its workers like robots under stringent monitoring systems, overlooking the human aspect of their labor. This underscores the urgent need for ethical AI deployment and active involvement in shaping its future.\nAI: A Reflection of Human Flaws and Aspirations\nArtificial Intelligence, whether superintelligent or God-like, is ultimately a human creation and thus inherits human flaws as well as their brilliance. Herding argues for the urgent need to harness AI for humanity’s benefit, warning that it might otherwise become a danger. Technologies developed by humans reflect both their aspirations and their imperfections, revealing both our disappointments and darker aspects over time.\nEvolving Demands and AI’s Power Players\nThe demand for science and technology evolves over time. In different eras, sea travel, communication, and oil were pivotal. Now, it is computer science. AI is predominantly controlled by powerful entities driven by profit motives. Herding emphasizes that this concentration of AI development in the hands of private giants, rather than under government control as in past scientific developments, could lead to serious repercussions. Silicon Valley grapples with cultural issues, where women and underrepresented groups often face challenges, leading to a decline in trust and an increase in greed.\nThe Political Nature of Technological Advancement\nTechnological development is inherently political, with preferences changing over time. Major advancements, like the internet, required substantial effort. Steering AI in the right direction will necessitate tremendous work from the government, technology companies, and the public. The US moon landing missions were politically motivated, debunking the notion that science is neutral. Similarly, AI’s development is influenced by geopolitical interests, with China and the US racing for dominance.\nAI: From Benefits to National Security Concerns\nAI is globally seen as a peaceful and aspiring technology, but unlike government-regulated programs, its direction is dominated by private giants. China’s goal to lead in AI by 2030 and the US’s competitive stance highlight the concept of an “AI arms race,” shifting the focus from AI’s benefits and risks to its potential as a tool for national security. AI has been used for defense purposes, and its misuse, such as in Gaza, demands immediate intervention.\nMilitary and Economic AI: The New Geopolitical Battlefield\nAI is a new geopolitical field that must be won, leading to techno-nationalism. The Sino-US race for AI dominance involves a pursuit of superior technology without corresponding efforts to shape global norms. AI is viewed primarily as a means of national interest and competition, with little imagination beyond these constraints.\nThe Need for International Cooperation\nHerding uses the IVF debate as a parallel to illustrate the necessity of societal acceptance for scientific advancements. The human egg donation debate, a significant aspect of IVF, raised numerous ethical issues, prompting the UK government to form specialized committees to address these concerns. One notable outcome was the establishment of the 14-day rule, which set ethical boundaries for embryo research. This historical example underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks and societal consensus in guiding scientific progress, a principle that Herding argues is equally crucial for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.\nPublic Acceptance and Disruption\nPublic acceptance and disruption in science are necessary, Herding argues, and she raises concerns about AI technologies being captured by a corporate mindset. The book also addresses the issue of AI-generated images being weaponized, as seen in Pakistan, where fake images are used for propaganda.\nThe Role of Experts and Regulation\nHandling these issues is challenging, and some limitations on AI technology use are necessary. A committee of trusted experts should make sensible decisions regarding AI technology. She advocates for compromise, humility, and the acceptance of diverse viewpoints, qualities she finds lacking in the tech industry. The book critiques the concentration of AI development within private companies, which creates proprietary technologies that cannot be easily scrutinized, leading to a dangerous power imbalance.\nThe Influence of Powerful Entities\nPowerful entities with vast resources develop AI that benefits their own values and services, creating a dangerous power imbalance. This alters the character of AI itself. Opposition to what higher education has become, a factory treating students like data, mirrors concerns about AI development.\nThe Impact of Technology on Society\nTechnology drives economic growth and expands opportunities. However, the concentration of wealth and power in the tech industry raises concerns about its impact on democracy and society. Regulation and oversight are crucial to ensure AI benefits all, not just the powerful few.\nConclusion\nAI Needs You by Verity Herding is a compelling and insightful exploration of AI’s potential and the ethical, societal, and political challenges it presents. Herding’s arguments are well-researched and thought-provoking, making the book a must-read for anyone interested in the future of artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity. The book is a call to action, urging readers to engage actively in shaping AI’s future to ensure it benefits humanity as a whole while maintaining ethical standards."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pakistani universities were mainly launched as teaching institutions like many colleges in the United States in the 19th century. There were limited research programs. Later, research element was introduced with a focus on quantity and achievement of certain metrics. As a result, more faculty and staff were recruited besides adding many bureaucratic staff in the name of quality enhancement, commercialization of research, and creating an imbalance in the faculty pyramid among many others. Most of these administrative jobs were created in the name of improving quality of research.\nPension, salaries, and many other expenditures besides having more staff have increased manifold over time. Successive governments have not increased financing of the universities proportionate to their budgetary requirements. Universities are hard pressed to use the instrument of increasing fee and increasing enrolment without any concern for the quality."

    "title": "Virtual Learning: A WayForward for Higher Education",
    "section": "Business as Usual",
    "text": "Business as Usual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion is how long this business-as-usual (BAU) approach will allow universities put extra burden on students’ parent pockets. Parents are already facing economic miseries due to high inflation and limited earning opportunities. What are possible solutions and way-forward. This requires serious introspection and integrated thinking for reimagining higher education in the third decade of the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\nScaling and Developing Learning Outcome Ecosystem\nWorld has gone digital and covid-19 pandemic has exposed the globe for online learning and Pakistan too have remained in this phase for two years. So digital emersion can help universities to come out of not only financial crisis but also can play an effective role in reaching those who have been unserved so far either due to financial constraints or limited enrollment capacity of the universities.\n\n\n\n Moreover, it will help millions of Pakistanis to benefit from reputed Professors who are currently accessible to a privileged 100 or students per year. On one hand, Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the entire traditional education system across the globe. But simultaneously it has opened many new opportunities to have tertiary education accessible to masses which was not possible before covid-19 pandemic. Cost of tertiary education is very high and has also limited capacity for scaling at large scale. But post-Covid-19 pandemic era has made it possible to provide tertiary education to most if not all at very affordable cost besides provision of flexible learning opportunities so that no one is left behind.\nChange is already here. Technological companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all are offering their own badges, certificates, and credentials. Though these are for entry level jobs, gradually these companies will move up the educational food chain. These companies already carry an advantage of being operating at scale.\nOnline learning is different than distance learning and those who express their reservations about online learning and prefer physical learning basically confuse “Learning” and “Time”. Their focus is on “Time” as fixed variable while “Learning” as a variable. But the concept of making “Learning” as fixed and “Time” as variable can make both online learning equally or even more useful than physical learning. While both can be good or bad in routine. Don’t proponents of physical learning think that delivering a lecture to 40 to 50 students for three hours in one go per week and expecting students to grasp all the stuff is not a workable idea. Virtual learning mode with competency-based learning not only provides live lecture but also opportunity to understand it after the class.\nSecondly, virtual, and online learning mode will not only help to have more enrollment but also significant reduction in cost of delivery of lecturing. To have experiential learning, there can be gradual shift towards this online learning and initially general courses can be offered by Pakistani leading scholars in the field across the country. If one fourth or one fifth courses can be offered through virtual mode with Pakistan leading scholars at the first stage, it will immensely benefit all stakeholders- students, universities and higher education management. To overcome the fear of cheating, exams can be conducted at respective departments. This will not only reduce financial burden on universities’ exchequer but also help students to learn from scholars of international repute instead of each batch of forty to fifty students getting different quality education from part time teachers. This financial cushion maybe utilized for research and providing fee concessions to students.\nIf post-Covid online learning opportunity will not be utilized, future of universities will become highly uncertain. All public sector universities are in serious financial crisis and are unable to spare money for research and development as these are already short of paying their salaries, pensions, and utilities. How long will universities survive on this ever-increasing deficit model? How long one can resist for not adapting oneself to changing circumstances? What level of compromise on quality of soft and hard infrastructure universities will afford?\nScaling of higher education through digital and online learning platform will be a win-win situation both for the universities and society. There will be new forms of content delivery, new ways to access learning, and new ways to certify that a learner has mastered various concepts. Above all, online platforms are one of the main tools for reaching the unreachable.\nBusiness as usual will not help to resolve universities’ financial issues even if there is some budget increase by the government which is a remote possibility in the next couple of years due to national and international economic concerns. Our universities’ financial viability depends how diligently we work on finding solutions to our problems by ourselves instead of getting some consultants and managing some aid to overcome crisis for the time being."

    "title": "Mental Junk Food: Bullshit Superspreader",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is mental junk food? How does it spread misinformation/disinformation? What skills are required to spot and call bullshit? These are important questions for all of us to ponder about for self-awareness and helping society to differentiate between misinformation/disinformation and facts.\nWe have been warned by junk food for decades to maintain our physical health, and medical doctors always emphasize on using simple food. Junk food is tasty and enjoyable in the moment but lacks nutritional value and can be detrimental to health over time. But there is little talk about mental junk food. Mental junk food refers to content, activities, or behaviours that intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling, often providing short-term pleasure of distraction, but lacking in depth, meaning, or substance. Such activities may engage one with minimum effort and provide entertainment and keep one engaged for hours due to retention algorithms designed by social media giants. \nA country like Pakistan where consuming too much junk food has yet not been the norm as most of its population can’t afford. But mental junk food is cheap and easily accessible, therefore, a large population is consuming excessive mental junk food which has very detrimental effects on personal well-being, society, family and community. Pakistan has very low literacy rate and digital literacy rate is almost non-existent, so  differentiating between propaganda and facts is difficult to identify.  This has made things worse in terms of having meaningful dialogue and argument on any major issue of national or regional importance. This mounting pressure of social media puts undue pressure on governments, bureaucracy, organizations and even judiciary. As a result, there is high probability that right decision making is compromised.\nPoliticians, media, science, academia, policy makers, start ups among others are engaged in spreading/rewarding misinformation/disinformation over analytics. Each of us, even if few of us knows its misinformation/disinformation, contribute to its share.\nBullshit comes in the form of rhetoric or fancy language, what we call old-school bullshit. Politicians, media, science, academia, policy makers , start ups and many others are engaged in spreading/rewarding  misinformation/disinformation/propaganda over analytics. New propaganda strategy is to use data based analysis which becomes difficult to refute due to lack of knowledge about those sophisticated tools. Even though each of us knows this is bullshit but we all contribute to its share.\nPeople don’t have time but have smartphones to spread bullshit. Despite the fact that one can easily check facts due to technology available in one’s hand, bullshit goes largely unchallenged. Technology has made bullshit worse. To get quality information, we face the temptation to click on the informational equivalent of empty calories, the mental junk food usually wins. Click-driven media and the most successful headlines don’t convey facts, they promise an emotional experience. Fluffy and glitter overtaken in depth thoughtful content. Media is busy in keeping people engaged instead of keeping them informed.\nBullshit has been prevailing for millions of years even among animals according to scientific research, but it has become more rapid due to low cost of spreading information. Access to internet has made it easy to spread whatever one likes. Today anyone with one’s personal computer and internet connection can produce professional-looking document and distribute them around the world without cost. All this can be done their pyjamas.\nThis easy and almost free creation of the mindless lists, quizzes, memes, misinformation about scientific findings and celebrity gossip that proliferate social media have diverted us from thoughtful analyses of the sort one used to see in the leading daily print media.\nSocial media has firehouse strategy, our trust in friends and institutions erode. Gary Kasparov Russian chess grandmaster summarized this approach in a post on Twitter: “The point of modern propaganda isn’t only to misinform or push an agenda, It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.”  Prior to the Internet, news papers, periodical made money by selling subscriptions and cared about quality of information a source provided, its accuracy, and its relevance to your daily life. To attract subscribers and retain them, publishers provided novel and well-vetted information. In this digital era, being careful is admirable but it does not sell ads. Social media is fertile ground for disinformation. Incentives are to spread information without worrying about its content.\nSatirist Jonathan Swift wrote in 1710 that “falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it.”\nOne can summarize it as :\ni) misinformation/disinformation takes less work to create than to clean up,\nii) takes less intelligence to create than to clean up, and\niii) spreads faster than efforts to clean it up.\nHow to spot and call misinformation/disinformation/falsehood in this environment.  Spotting bullshit is tantamount to walking around at night where we are aware of our surroundings and alert for signs of danger. We must learn how to question the source of information. Who is telling us all this? How does he or she know it? What is this person trying to sell us?  There is an urgent need to work on digital literacy not only among the masses but among the educated one so that they can spot and call bullshit. Spotting bullshit is important for an individual to know about it while calling bullshit is more important as it means conveying others about the same bullshit.\nNote: Word “Bullshit” is used in the context of lie, invention, falsehood, untruth, propaganda, misinformation, fabrication, white lie, half-truth, a tissue of lies, fairy tale without any offense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
