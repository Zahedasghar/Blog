I am Professor at School of Economics, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. I have extensive background working with applied econometrics, development issues (food security, urban and health) and using advanced analytics to enable data stakeholders to make informed decisions. I have also served as Director, School of Economics, Registrar Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad and I am also member of Research Advisory Committee (RAC) of [RASTA Competitive Grants Program for Policy-oriented Research](https://rasta.pide.org.pk/research-advisory-committee/).

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Impact Evaluation Tools, Quarto, tidymodels, doing economics with R, and data visualization using animation and interactivity. I am passionate about skills for jobs now and in the future, Virtual learning with new educational accounting system. I am also learning how quantitative reasoning and logic with media , digital and data literacy may help to lead actionable initiatives to spot and call fake/nonsense news.
