I am Professor at School of Economics, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. I have extensive background working with applied econometrics, development issues (food security, urban and health) and using advanced analytics to enable data stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in R environment, and data visualization using animation and interactivity. I am passionate about skills for jobs now and in the future, Virtual learning with new educational accounting system. I am also learning how quantitative reasoning and logic with media , digital and data literacy may help to overcome fake news issues and lead actionable initiatives.
